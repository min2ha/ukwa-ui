This results in many millions of websites and billions of individual "assets" (html pages, images, pdf’s, video’s etc.).</p><p>We also save a selected number websites more frequently (up to daily).</p><p>In addition to this we regularly focus on collecting websites on specific events, subjects or areas of interest and group them in <a href="collections">Special Collections</a>.</p><p>Only material on the open web is collected, nothing private.

Use a phrase or name that you think is most likely to be in the website and in that website alone. This will search across all the archived websites.</p><p>There are several options for narrowing your search. For example, a phrase search uses more than one term (i.e. more than a single word). If two (or more) terms are submitted without the use of quotes, only one of those terms need appear in the documents to produce a result. If the terms are quoted, then only that precise string will be returned. See the Query Syntax section below for full details.</p><p>Having submitted your query you can further refine your search using the facets on the left-hand side of the full text search results page. This allows the matching results to be filtered by various properties, such as content type, collection and crawl year. For example, you can use the "Refine by domain suffix" facet to limit the results set to those resources hosted on domains with names that share the same common suffix, such as "co.uk", "ac.uk" or "com".</p><p>Note that all queries are case-insensitive.</p><br/><h2>Query Syntax</h2>  <table>    <tr>      <td>Query type</td>      <td>Example</td>      <td>Description</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Logical AND</td>      <td><a href="search?text=economics+finance&search_location=full_text&content_type=Web+Page">economics finance</a>, <a href="search?text=economics+AND+finance&search_location=full_text&content_type=Web+Page&content_type=Web+Page&content_type=Web+Page">economics AND finance</a></td>      <td>Returns resources containing the words 'economics' and "finance", but not necessarily together.</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Logical OR</td>      <td><a href="search?text=breakfast+OR+marmalade&search_location=full_text&content_type=Web+Page">breakfast OR marmalade</a></td>      <td>Returns resources containing either the word "breakfast" or the word "marmalade"</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Logical NOT</td>      <td><a href="search?text=coffee+NOT+java&search_location=full_text&content_type=Web+Page">coffee NOT java</a></td>      <td>Returns resources containing the word "coffee", but excluding all resources that contain the word "java".</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Phrase search</td>      <td><a href="search?text="Tony+Blair"&search_location=full_text&content_type=Web+Page">"Tony Blair"</a></td>      <td>Returns resources containing the exact phrase "tony blair".</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Proximity search</td>      <td><a href="search?text="coffee+java"~25&search_location=full_text&content_type=Web+Page">"coffee java"~25</a></td>      <td>Returns resources where the words "coffee" and "java" appear within 25 words of each other.</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Proximity phrase search</td>      <td><a href="search?text="%28"Tony+Blair"%29+%28"Rupert+Murdoch"%29"~10&search_location=full_text&content_type=Web+Page">"("Tony Blair") ("Rupert Murdoch")"~10</a></td>      <td>Returns resources where the exact phrases "Tony Blair" and "Rupert Murdoch") appear within 10 words of each other.</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Single character wildcard</td>      <td><a href="search?text=mart%3Fn&search_location=full_text&content_type=Web+Page&content_type=Web+Page">mart?n</a></td>      <td>A 'wildcard' search where a single character in the term might vary &mdash; the question mark symbol (i.e., "?") can be used in its place.

faq.a1 =  There are millions of UK websites. They are constantly changing and even disappearing. Often they contain information that is only available on the Web. Responding to the challenge of a potential "digital black hole" web archives are designed to safeguard as many of these websites as practical. The purpose of the UK Web Archive is to collect, preserve and give permanent access to key UK websites for future generations. 
faq.a2 = The UK Web Archive collects millions of websites each year and billions of individual assets (pages, images, videos, pdfs etc.). As of 2017 we have collected approximately 500TB of data and increasing this by over roughly 60 – 70 TB a year.
faq.a3 = The majority of the archive is collected as part of our big annual uk domain crawl. Selected websites are archived more frequently based on, factors such as the rate of change of the website or its relevance to a particular collection. For example many news sites are collected on a daily basis whereas others are visited less frequently.
faq.a4 = As per the Non-Print Legal Deposit regulations we the six UK Legal Deposit Libraries are empowered to collect any and all UK based websites. In effect this includes all websites that have a UK top level domain name such as .UK, .SCOT, .WALES, .CYMRU and .LONDON plus any websites that are identified as being hosted on a server located physically in the UK via a geo-ip lookup. Additionally, if a website contains a UK postal address or the website owner confirms UK residence or place of business their website can be included. In order to build comprehensive thematic website collections, we occasionally request permission to archive non-UK websites from the site owner. 
faq.a5 = The Legal Deposit Libraries Act (2003) extended existing Legal Deposit Legislation to non-print (electronic) publications, including websites, subject to further enabling Regulations, enacted in 2013. Since the enabling Regulations came into force in 2013, the UK Legal Deposit Libraries, have been archiving UK websites with the caveat that this material is only available to view on Library premises unless we have an additional permission from the website publisher to make the content more widely available.  
faq.a6 = No. Websites are reflected for the benefit of future researchers; they are intended to be reflective of contemporary UK life or for their relevance to a particular collection. Judgement is not made on the validity or quality of website content. Archived websites will vary in sophistication, from the very technical and dynamic to more simple, ‘home grown’ publications. 
faq.a7 =  The UK Web Archive will be ingested into the Digital Library System, a long term digital repository developed by the British Library and supported by the other UK Legal Deposit Libraries.<br/><br/>The Digital Library System is maintained in a secure environment, with network links protected by firewalls and virus checking systems, and with no public internet access. It has four storage nodes located in St Pancras, Boston Spa, Aberystwyth and Edinburgh. Each node stores a full copy of all the materials held within the system. The nodes are in constant communication with each other across a secure network, with automated routines for self‐checking, replication and repair; if a digital file stored in one of the nodes becomes corrupted or lost, it is automatically restored from one of the other nodes. Furthermore, each node also uses a technical arrangement by which files are copied and stored on two or more physical disks, with self‐checking and replication between the disks.
faq.a8 = Absolutely! Please let us know of any UK based website that you feel should be archived via our Save a website form.
faq.a9 = As soon as practically possible, after our basic quality assurance and indexing processes have been run to prepare archival copies for access. You will not see your archived website through the online UK Web Archive unless you have completed a permission form. We currently have a large backlog of content to be made available through the UK Web Archive so please be patient with us. 
faq.a10 = It is likely that we have not identified the website either manually or automatically through our domain crawls, this is particularly likely if the website does not have a UK top level domain name, for example if it is on a .com domain name. If this is the case and the website is UK please save it (link to form). Some websites may exist in our reading room collection – without the additionally permission of the website publisher we cannot make it available through the UK Web Archive.<br/><br/>Websites are gathered at a particular point in time by harvesting software and are intended to reflect as completely as possible how the website looked and behaved on the Internet at that time. An attempt is made to gather all of the objects associated with a website including html, images, PDF documents, audio and video files and other objects such as programming scripts.<br/><br/>However, even the state-of-the-art web crawlers used by the UK Web Archive have technical limitations and are currently unable to capture streaming media, deep web or database content requiring user input, interactive components based on programming scripts or content which requires plug-ins for rendering. This means that certain elements in some of the archived websites are not present.<br/><br/>Another reason some archived websites are not complete is that occasionally only one page of the site was ever intended for the archive. This may be due to the kind of permission granted for archiving or may be because the selector regarded the single page as sufficiently representing one aspect within a Special Collection.<br/><br/>Finally, websites often link to other websites and it is not always clear to the user that they do so. Unless the linked-to website has also been archived by the UK Web Archive a "Resource Not in Archive" message will be displayed.<br/><br/>The UK Web Archive is designed to support as many browsers as possible however different browsers may display the same website differently. 
faq.a11 = We respect intellectual property rights (IPR) and data privacy. We seek the appropriate permissions from rights holders before archiving and operate a Notice and Take-down Procedure to take down web sites from UK Web Archive under exceptional circumstances.
faq.a12 =  It's important for any person making work publicly available on the Internet to be careful with their personal information and that of others. The UK Web Archive collects web pages that are freely and openly available on the Internet. The UK Web Archive does not collect password protected content (unless specific permission has been given), or pages on secure servers such as email and Intranets.<br/><br/>However, if you have queries about material in the UK Web Archive that you feel may infringe your privacy please contact the Archive.
